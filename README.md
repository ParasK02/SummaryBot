# Summary Bot

Summz is an AI-powered web application that uses OpenAI's API through rapid API to summarize the given URL. It has the capability of summarizing web pages to give a concise description of the contents of the page. Moreover, it can summarize traditional long writing into a shorter version. Similar to the popular AI platform ChatGPT the website keeps a history of the links provided so it can be easily accessed after providing multiple articles.
